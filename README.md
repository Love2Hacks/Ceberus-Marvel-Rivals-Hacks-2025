### ‚ú® Core

Exploring technical approaches to bypass anti-cheat systems in a game like Marvel Rivals, focusing on low-level techniques and activity hiding.
# The cheats work exclusively through cloud services, which reduces the risk of blocking to ZERO.
# Only proxied servers are used and does not allow the game to detect interference in root files!

### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

| Component / Technique        | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Hypothetical Application in Marvel Rivals                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **‚¨áÔ∏è Low-Level Bypass**      | Working below the user-mode, closer to the operating system kernel, to gain higher privileges and evade detection by user-mode anti-cheat components.              | Hypothetically, a kernel driver could intercept anti-cheat calls or hide process memory access.<br>System call hooking might redirect anti-cheat queries to return false data.<br>Running the game in a modified virtual environment. |
| **üëª Activity Hiding**       | Making the cheat software appear invisible or legitimate to the anti-cheat system.                                                                                      | Injecting code into trusted system processes (highly risky üí•).<br>Masquerading the cheat process name and attributes.<br>Hiding handles used by the anti-cheat to interact with the game or cheat process.                            |
| **üìä Data Analysis & Mod.**  | Reading and potentially modifying game data to gain information or advantage.                                                                                           | Scanning game memory for player positions, character states, ability cooldowns.<br>Analyzing network packets for real-time game information.<br>Hypothetically modifying game files (e.g., textures for visibility, though easily detected). |
| **üéØ Cheat Implementation**  | Utilizing the gained data and bypass methods to implement cheat functionalities.                                                                                        | **Wallhack (WH):** Visualizing enemy characters through walls.<br>**AimBot (AB):** Automatically aiming at targets (with varying degrees of human-like simulation).<br>**ESP (Extra Sensory Perception):** Displaying player names, health, distance, etc.<br>**No Recoil/Spread:** Eliminating weapon recoil and bullet spread. |
| **üîÑ Updates & Adaptation**  | Mechanisms to stay ahead of anti-cheat updates and detection methods.                                                                                                    | Automatic updating of the cheat software.<br>Employing polymorphic code to change the cheat's structure.<br>Rapid analysis and adaptation to new anti-cheat detection vectors.                                                 |

### ü§î Hypothetical Challenges & Risks

| Aspect                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Complexity**  | Requires extremely deep knowledge of Windows internals, reverse engineering, network protocols, and anti-cheat mechanisms. Building stable and undetectable low-level software is a monumental task.                                                                 |
| üèÉ **Constant Arms Race**   | Anti-cheat systems are constantly evolving. New detection methods are deployed regularly, making any bypass solution temporary and requiring continuous updates.                                                                                                   |
| üö® **High Detection Risk** | Despite bypass efforts, anti-cheats can detect suspicious behavior, network anomalies, or patterns of memory access. Kernel-level anti-cheats are particularly difficult to evade.                                                                                       |
| üö´ **Account Ban**         | Using cheats almost invariably leads to a permanent ban of the game account.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| üí• **System Instability**  | Incorrectly implemented low-level techniques can lead to game crashes, system errors (BSODs), or even damage to the operating system.                                                                                                                               |
| ‚öñÔ∏è **Legal Consequences**   | In some jurisdictions, creating or distributing software designed to bypass anti-cheat systems can have legal repercussions.                                                                                                                                      |
